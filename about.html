        <div id="content1">
          <p>My name is Connor, and I am currently a high school student. I do well<br>
          in school. I am mostly a bit lazy, but when I have a goal I really want to accomplish,<br>
          I will work hard to achieve it. I really like technology, and I spend my free time<br>
          playing video games. I am a pacifist, and I like to help others. I do not know what<br>
          my religion is, but I do believe in the soul and that there is something that happens<br>
          after a person dies.</p>

            <p>My current goals as of right now are learning Javascript, learning how to use forms,<br>
              and making this website as good as possible. My long-term goals are figuring out what<br>
              kind of career I am going to pursue, graduating from High School, getting into a good<br>
              college, and being a successful person overall. I also plan to join a video game company.</p>

          <p>I have achieved many things in life, such as learning how to use HTML, learning<br>
            how to use CSS, learning how to use Javascript, getting good grades so far in school,<br>
            and learning how to use a bit of the coding language "Python."</p>

            <img src="symbol.png" width="150" id="symbol" alt="Symbol">
            <p>This is a symbol I made for myself, created on 10/11/2018.<br>
              The symbol has many meanings. My initials, C.M., are represented by<br>
              the crescent moon and the triangles around the lower circle, respectively.<br>
              The crescent moon is a representation of a "C" turned at a 90-degree angle,<br>
              and if the two triangles at the top of the circle are turned around 45-degrees<br>
              in different directions, the triangles almost make the shape of an "M".<br>
              The symbol in its entirety has similarites to my zodiac symbol, Taurus.<br>
              I was born on a new moon, which is represented by the hole in the circle<br>
              at the bottom.</p>
