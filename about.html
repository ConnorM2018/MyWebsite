        <div id="dropdown-content" onmouseover="showcontent(content1)" onmouseout="hidecontent(dropdown-content)">
          <p id="content1">My name is Connor, and I am currently a high school student. I do<br>
	           very well in school, but I have a bit of a lazy personality. I spend<br>
             most if not all of my free time on a computer, and I have a lot of<br>
             interest in computers. During my freshman year of high school, I took<br>
             a class in web designing. I learned about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I<br>
             found web designing to be really interesting, and decided that I would<br>
             pursue a career in which I could be a web designer of some sort.<br>
             However, other than that, I do not have much of an idea of what sort of<br>
             career I will exactly choose; being a web designer who is paid money to<br>
             make website for random companies on occasion just doesn't seem like a<br>
             reliable way of getting money. I hope that I can soon figure out exactly<br>
             what sort of career I want. I am considering becoming a detective, but<br>
             I am not sure.</p>

              college, and being a successful person overall.</p>

              This is a symbol I made for myself, created on 10/11/2018.<br>
              The symbol has many meanings. My initials, C.M., are represented by<br>
              the crescent moon and the triangles around the lower circle, respectively.<br>
              The crescent moon is a representation of a "C" turned at a 90-degree angle,<br>
              and if the two triangles at the top of the circle are turned around 45-degrees<br>
              in different directions, the triangles almost make the shape of an "M".<br>
              The symbol in its entirety has similarites to my zodiac symbol, Taurus.<br>
              I was born on a new moon, which is represented by the hole in the circle<br>
              at the bottom.</p>
