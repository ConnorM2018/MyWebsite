          <p id="p">My name is Connor, and I am a highschool freshman. I plan to become<br>
            the web designer for the company I join, due to my skill with web designing.<br>
            I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript during my freshman year of high school.<br>
            Between each project, starting on 9/17/2018, I decided to start working on my<br>
            final project (this website). I spend almost all of my freetime on a computer, <br>
            so it was no suprise that I wanted to learn how  to design websites.<br>
            I also made a logo for myself. It is the "CM" at the top of this page. Every time<br>
            I put my initials on something, I would place the "C" and the "M" as shown in that<br>
            logo.

            <p id="p">My most notable skill is <b>the ability to create websites.</b><br>
              I have known how to create websites since I was 14 years old. In fact,<br>
              100% of the source code for this website was written by me.<br>
