          <p id="p">My name is Connor, and I am currently a high school student. I do very well<br>
            in school, but I have a bit of a lazy personality. I spend most if not all of my free<br>
            time on a computer, and I have a lot of interest in computers. During my freshman year<br>
            of high school, I took a class in web designing. I learned about HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br>
            I found web designing to be really interesting, and decided that I would pursue a career<br>
            in which I could be a web designer of some sort. However, other than that, I do not have<br>
            much of an idea of what sort of career I will exactly choose; being a web designer who is<br>
            paid money to make website for random companies on occasion just doesn't seem like a reliable<br>
            way of getting money. I hope that I can soon figure out exactly what sort of career I want.<br>

              I have known how to create websites since I was 14 years old. In fact,<br>
              100% of the source code for this website was written by me.<br>
