        <h1>WHO I AM</h1>
        <p id="paragraph1">I am a (soon-to-be) web designer, and I currently know HTML. I still have yet to<br>
          learn CSS and Javascript, however I will learn both before the end of 2018. By then,<br>
          this website will be complete.<br>
          I am an A/B high school student, and I spend most of my free time on a computer. During my<br>
          Freshman year, I took web design. This website is actually a result of a project. I plan to<br>
          make this website perfect to the point that it can become my personal website. I don't know<br>
          what kind of career I will pursue once I graduate from college, but I believe that when I do<br>
          get a job, it will probably be one where I can create the website for my company.
