        <p id="paragraph1">I am a high school student, and I plan to pursue a career in web designing.<br>
          I currently know HTML, and I still have yet to learn CSS and Javascript; however, I will learn<br>
           both before the end of 2018. By then, this website will be complete. I am an A/B high school student,<br>
          and I spend most of my free time on a computer. During my Freshman year, I took web design. This website<br>
          is actually a result of a project. I plan to make this website perfect to the point that it can become<br>
          my personal website. I don't know what kind of career I will pursue once I graduate from college, but I<br>
          believe that when I do get a job, it will probably be one where I can create the website for my company.
